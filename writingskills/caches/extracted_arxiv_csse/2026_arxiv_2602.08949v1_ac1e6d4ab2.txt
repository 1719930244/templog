ABSTRACT
According to the United Nations, wildfire frequency and intensity are projected to increase by
approximately 14% by 2030 and 30% by 2050 due to global warming, posing critical threats to
life, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Conventional disaster-management frameworks rely on static
simulations and passive data acquisition, which hinders their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving
wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual
Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin(DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI
agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest

cause.Inrecentyears,thefrequencyandseverityofwildfires
have increased due to climate change [1]. Wildfires have
led to billions in economic losses, irreversible ecological
destruction, and the loss of lives and livelihoods. The 2023
Maui wildfires in Hawaii, for instance, resulted in over 100
deaths and destroyed nearly the entire town of Lahaina [2].
In 2024, California experienced 8,024 wildfires, burning a
total of 1,050,012 acres, destroying 1,716 structures, and
resulting in one fatality [3]. Economic losses from the 2024
California wildfires are estimated between $250 billion and
$275billion,makingitoneofthecostliestwildfiredisasters

Despiteadvancesindetectionandmodeling,the“golden

that could prevent escalation.
Various novel technologies may hold the key to imple-
menting effective solutions for better collecting, analyzing,
and responding to fast-moving catastrophic fire events. A
digital twin (DT) is a real-time virtual representation of a
physical entity or system, continuously updated with live
data to reflect its current state [7, 8]. In early versions of the
DT,itwasusedtoimprovesystemunderstandingandpredict
failures by utilizing a live digital model that collected data
from the physical system with sensors [9, 10]. During the
past two decades, the DT concept expanded from aerospace
and manufacturing to many other domains [11] – including
civilinfrastructure,energygrids,healthcare,andsmartcities
– as advances in IoT and computing made real-time data
integration feasible on larger scales [12].

Digital Twin and Agentic AI for Wild Fire Disaster Management: Intelligent Virtual Situation Room
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing field
withwide-rangingimplicationsacrossnearlyalldisciplines,
including fire engineering [14, 15]. One emerging area
within AI is the development of autonomous AI agents,
where they are equipped with the ability to utilize tools
and make decisions to complete tasks [16]. These AI agents
have the potential to become a critical resource in modern
disaster relief, offering enhanced speed, intelligence, and
coordination to support more informed decision-making by
humans [17].
Yet, some fundamental questions remain unresolved,
even as DT and AI technologies continue to evolve rapidly
andbecomeincreasinglyintegratedintosmartsystems.This
research investigates the following questions:
RQ1: What are the current use cases of bidirectional
digital twins (BDTs) in the context of wildfire manage-
ment? RQ2: In what ways and configurations can an AI

on case studies from industry and literature, what are the
implications of an AI agent–based BDT for wildfire man-
agement?
To answer these questions, we review the literature,

2.1. Digital Cities
Digital City Infrastructure and Technologies
Modern digital cities are built using advanced technol-
ogy that works together [18]. Sensor networks (environ-
mental sensors, cameras, smart meters) and IoT devices
continuouslymonitorurbanconditions[19],fromweatherto
traffictostructuralhealth.Wirelesscommunicationsystems
also carry the data to improve the latency performance and
providereal-time,citywide,andsituationalinformation[20].
The collected data is input into cloud-based centralized
platforms. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and 3D
city modeling [21] software play a key role by correlating
data streams to spatial locations and creating interactive
maps or virtual city models that reflect current conditions
[22, 23]. Also, ML/DL techniques are employed to de-
tect(safety monitoring [24, 25]) and predict outcomes [26–
28]. Some examples include modeling the spread of fire
[29, 30] or predicting traffic [31], anomaly detection [32],
anddetectingabnormaltrends[33],likeanincreaseinwater
usage that may reveal a leakage [34]. Also, more enabling
technologies have been added, such as building DTs, which
gives 3D representations of buildings [35]; encryption and
cyber security systems, which securely communicate data
[36, 37]; and edge computing, which processes the data
locally [38, 39].

tionsnetworks,cloud/GIS,andAI-poweredanalytics—form

Role of Digital Cities in Disaster Management
Digital city technologies have become critical tools in
disaster management, as they improve how cities prepare
for, respond to, and recover from emergencies by enabling
more transparent communication and stronger coordination
[40,41].Inthispart,themaincontributionsmadebydigital
cities toward disaster management will be introduced as
follows:
Smart cities employ distributed sensors and analytics
to detect threats or abnormal events immediately [42]. For
instance, the city’s digital platform can sense a sudden drop
inwaterpressureorsurgeinseismicmovementsandtrigger
instant warnings. A good example involved using a DT for
the city to process incoming sensor data intelligently and
triggerautomatedSMSwarningsforemergencies(e.g.,fires
within a building or flash flooding [43]).
Also,withthefusionofreal-timemulti-sourcedata,digi-
talcitiesgenerateacommonoperatingpictureduringacrisis
[44, 45]. City dashboards synthesize the feeds from CCTV
cameras,trafficsensors,weatherstations,andcrowdreports
to give responders live maps of dynamic circumstances.
For example, analysts employed a DT of a city to process
livesurveillancecamfeeds,identifycongestionlevelsalong

strike [48] or chemical spill [49] can be simulated and
tested via digital models. Studies have shown that a high-
fidelity DT of a city can simulate disaster scenarios – e.g.,
the spread of flooding and the damage resulting from a
hypothetical flood –. By examining various scenarios (e.g.,
varying earthquake magnitudes [50, 51] and flood levels),
authorities can refine emergency plans, such as adjusting

evacuation zones and resource staging areas based on the
simulation results [44].
Resource coordination is one of the most widely used
applications of digital cities. A digital city platform can
monitorandcoordinatevitalresourceswithintheurbannet-
workduringacrisis[52].Thestatusofhospitals(availability
and ER status), emergency shelters (degree of occupancy),
utilities (power grid or water supply outages), fleets of re-
sponse vehicles, and number and distribution of available

dashboards[53,54].Thedigitalcitysystemcanfacilitatethe
deployment of teams and equipment where necessary and
adjust to crisis changes [55].
Digital cities also facilitate the way management com-
municates with citizens during emergencies [45, 56, 57].
The data for the city is continuously updated, and it can
be made available as live public data (e.g., through apps,
websites, or social media) to inform citizens about actions.
Many smart city systems ingest official sensor data, crowd-
sourced inputs, and social media signals to create a two-
way information flow [58]. This enables more localized and
timely public warnings and instructions. For example, a
city’s digital platform might push notifications about which
neighborhoods should evacuate while also ingesting tweets
or smartphone reports from citizens on the ground [59].
Research indicates that a DT Smart City can give the public
and decision-makers highly localized data about a develop-
ing disaster. By keeping citizens informed (and sometimes
engagingthemthroughreporting),digitalcitiesenhancethe
community’s ability to respond and prevent the spread of
misinformation during emergencies [60].
Figure 1 illustrates the use case of DT for disaster
management; this digital-city disaster management frame-
work features a three-level architecture. At its foundation,
the Sensors & Data Collection layer brings together asset-
based IoT devices (e.g., building sensors, smart meters) and
infrastructure-level sensors (e.g., satellites, ground-based
radar) to aggregate real-time environmental and structural
information. Such live data streams are then processed in
the Data Analytics and processing layer, where AI/ML
algorithms identify anomalies, and ETL pipelines scrub,
integrate, and normalize multisource feeds to take action.
Towards its upper end, the 3D Visualization layer provides
operators with interactive dashboards and GIS-enabled 3D
models, enabling them to view live conditions, simulate
“what-if” scenarios, and coordinate resources with pinpoint
accuracy—thereby closing the loop between sensing and
decision-making in emergencies. With these capabilities,
digital cities can better manage disasters.
2.2. Bidirectional Digital Twin: Concepts and
Architectures
A defining characteristic of a true DT is bidirectional
connectivity between the physical object and its virtual
model. The DT continuously ingests data from the physical
asset (e.g., through IoT sensors) [61]. In turn, the insights
or outputs from the DT can be fed back to influence the
physical asset’s operation [61]. For example, A DT of a
building might receive information on temperature [62] and
occupancy and, based on that, adjust the building’s HVAC
settings through control signals and create a feedback loop
[63]. As the physical system changes, the DT changes [64];
and When the situation within the digital counterpart of a
DTindicatesthatactionisnecessary,theintelligencecreated
from the analytics of the digital counterpart can be used to
initiate a response in the physical system. In a word, the DT
isalivingvirtualmodel;itprovidesacontinuous,up-to-the-
moment representation of a physical asset or process that
enables constant monitoring, analysis, and even control of
the asset in ways the static models of the past could never
hope to provide [65].
EnablingabidirectionalDTrequiresanarchitecturethat
facilitates continuous data exchange and feedback [66, 67].
In general, such an architecture contains several layers. At
the foundation, sensors and IoT devices on the physical
asset or environment collect real-time data (measurements,
status signals) and transmit them using wireless networks
or the internet to feed into the DT platform [68, 69]. The
incoming data is processed and integrated into the asset’s
virtual model. The DT platform (which may be hosted on
cloud servers or edge computers) continuously updates the
virtual model’s state. Advanced analytics, such as ML/DL
techniques[70,71],mightbeappliedatthisstagetoanalyze
the data, run simulations, or predict future states. Based on
theupdatedmodelandanalyses,theDTgeneratesoutputs–
alerts, optimization decisions, or direct control commands.
In a fully bidirectional setup, specific outputs are sent back
to the physical asset or to actuators in the environment to
adjust operations. For example, a DT of a power grid might
predictanoverloadandtriggeraload-balancingresponseby
routing electricity differently [72, 73]. In many real cases,
the"actuation"isindirect–theDTprovidesdecisionsupport
for human operators, who then implement actions in the
physical world [74].
Traditional monitoring systems often stopped at uni-
directional data reporting. By contrast, a bidirectional DT
continuously cycles information [75]. A clear illustration of
bidirectional DT is in next-generation early warning sys-
tems. Conventional early warning collects sensor data and
then issues warnings manually. With bidirectional DT early
warning, live sensor data is inputted to a digital city model
[76]. The system will automatically warn or trigger protec-
tive measures if it recognizes the danger. Such systems can
autonomouslyadaptandrespondtoevolvingrisksindisaster
management [77]. The applications range from micro-level
(e.g., an individual building’s DT helping firefighters navi-
gate it safely) to macro-level (a whole-region DT modeling
the spread of wildfires) [78–80].

ment have demonstrated capabilities for near real-time sim-
