Vulnerability disclosure is critical for ensuring the security and reliability of open source software (OSS). However, in practice,
many vulnerabilities are reported and discussed on public platforms before being formally disclosed, posing significant risks
to vulnerability management. Inadequate vulnerability disclosure can expose users to security threats and severely impact the
stability and reliability of software systems. For example, prior work shows that over 21% of CVEs are publicly discussed
before a patch is released. Despite its importance, we still lack clarity on the vulnerability disclosure practices adopted by open
source communities and the preferences of practitioners regarding vulnerability management. To fill this gap, we analyzed
the vulnerability disclosure practices of 8,073 OSS projects spanning from 2017 to 2023. We then conducted an empirical study
by surveying practitioners about their preferences and recommendations in vulnerability disclosure management. Finally, we
compared the survey results with the actual vulnerability practice observed within the OSS projects. Our results show that
while over 80% of practitioners support Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD), only 55% of vulnerabilities conform
to CVD in practice. Although only 20% of practitioners advocate discussions before disclosure, 42% of vulnerabilities are
discussed in issue reports before their disclosure. This study reveals the vulnerability management practices in OSS, provides
valuable guidance to OSS owners, and highlights potential directions to improve the security of OSS platforms.

1 INTRODUCTION
From small-scale projects to critical applications deployed on a global scale, open source software (OSS) is
widely used in the software industry [ 18, 57]. OSS offers numerous advantages [ 53] (e.g., low cost and high
quality [60]), but the use of OSS also brings security risks in the form of vulnerabilities [15, 16, 35, 46, 62]. Therefore,
vulnerability management is important in practice. To manage vulnerabilities, OSS developers need to put in
place a process that involves the identification, prioritization, and remediation of vulnerabilities. Documentation
resources from OSS projects, such as Wiki, Readme, or the project’s website, often offer guidance on reporting

and managing vulnerabilities, for which a commonly followed model is the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure
(CVD) [14, 29, 32, 44]. The CVD recommends that vulnerabilities are reported privately to software maintainers,
ensuring that key information remains confidential until maintainers are ready to make it public (e.g. after the
vulnerability is fixed), potentially preventing attackers from exploiting the reported vulnerability before a patch is
provided and its availability is officially disclosed [22]. However, in practice, numerous factors, including the lack
of expertise in the security domain [ 21] and limited knowledge in security management [ 1], often lead reporters
not to comply with CVD leading to the premature disclosure of vulnerabilities and providing attackers with
opportunities such as zero-day attacks [2, 8].
Recently, OSS vulnerability management has received considerable attention. Several works studied the
creation of disclosure histories model [ 30] and the analysis of vulnerability life cycle [ 3, 20, 54]. Researchers have
also evaluated the efficacy of vulnerability bounty programs and highlighted dangerous behaviors during the
vulnerability disclosure process [ 8, 36, 43]. Despite numerous studies on vulnerability management in OSS, few
studies [17, 28] have investigated practitioners’ preferences regarding disclosure models. In particular, to the best
of our knowledge, none of the previous research have studied the practitioners’ preferences of reporting channels,
pre-disclosure or post-disclosure discussions, and disclosure roles. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on
vulnerability disclosure practices within open source platforms (e.g. GitHub) and the discrepancies between
practitioners’ preferences and modus operandi. Acquiring insights into the perspectives of practitioners and
how they behave in practice is vital to improving the vulnerability disclosure process and discerning the key
factors in issue reporting. These insights can guide OSS owners when selecting appropriate security policies and
vulnerability disclosure management approaches.
To comprehensively understand the prevalence of vulnerability disclosure practices in OSS, we conducted
a large-scale empirical study of 21,501 vulnerabilities linked to GitHub repositories, combining data from the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD) [ 58] and GitHub Advisory (GHSA) [ 25]. We also surveyed 770 profes-
sional practitioners from 2,000 GitHub repositories that had previously reported Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVEs) [41] entries, gathering insights into their preferences and recommendations throughout the
vulnerability disclosure process. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive comparison between real-world practices
and practitioners’ preferences to explore the gap between these two aspects regarding vulnerability management.
In particular, we investigated the following two research questions:
RQ1: What are the prevalent vulnerability disclosure practices within the open source platform?
The main objective of RQ1 is to investigate the practices of vulnerability disclosure management in OSS. We
first analyzed the vulnerability handling guidance (e.g., security policy or vulnerability report channels) provided
by OSS. We then studied the OSS vulnerability practices by analyzing the vulnerability response (e.g., report,
patch, and disclosure) throughout the lifecycle of a vulnerability. We found that 62% of the studied OSS lack
information about vulnerability handling guidance. Furthermore, we observed several dangerous practices in
OSS. Specifically, 42% of CVEs are publicly discussed before their disclosure, and 34% of CVEs are fixed directly
(e.g., direct commits to the main branch) and explicitly (e.g., describe the vulnerability in the commit message),
which means attackers could discover the vulnerability before disclosure. Additionally, the decision whether
to use pull requests (PR) to merge fixes depends on the conventions of the projects and is correlated with the
severity of the vulnerability. In the cases of severe vulnerabilities, the tendency to use PRs decreases, leading to
faster fixes. Furthermore, in terms of vulnerability disclosure models, 56% of the studied vulnerabilities adhere to
a CVD approach, while 38% follow a full disclosure approach. Finally, vulnerabilities that are publicly reported
but left unfixed are often associated with small-scale and low-active projects, highlighting risks for the consumers
of these types of projects.
RQ2: What are the preferences of practitioners in the OSS community regarding vulnerability disclosure
management?

RQ2 investigates practitioners’ personal preferences in the realm of vulnerability disclosure. Among the
respondents, 65% have experience in handling security reports, while only 16.6% have ever requested a CVE. In
terms of their preferences for a vulnerability disclosure model, over 81% of the respondents prefer CVD, while
10% favor private disclosure and 7% prefer full disclosure. However, only 57% of the respondents believe that
public discussions should occur after the publication of the CVE, which contradicts the proportion of supporters
of CVD. Regarding the role of individuals opening CVEs, most of the respondents prefer security experts. As for
the channels for reporting vulnerabilities, most of the respondents favor direct contact with the organization
(73%) or using an existing issue tracking system (61%).
To investigate the gap between actual practices and preferences, and gain deeper insights, we conducted
a comparative analysis of vulnerability disclosure management practices and practitioners’ preferences. We
have uncovered some disparities: while over 80% of practitioners support the usage of CVD, only 56% of the
vulnerability disclosures conform to CVD. Although only 20% of practitioners advocate publicly discussing the
vulnerability before disclosure, 42% of the vulnerabilities are discussed in issue reports before their disclosure. This
discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that 60% of the repositories lack documentation about security policies
and private contact channels (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2) . Additionally, vulnerabilities that are publicly reported but
left unfixed are often associated with small-scale and low-active projects. To solve this problem, practitioners
can implement time limits for CVD. If a vulnerability remains unpatched beyond the specified time limit, full
disclosure of the vulnerability should be initiated to inform users about the existence of the vulnerability.
This paper makes the following contributions:
• A comprehensive investigation of how practitioners approach vulnerability disclosure in practice, based on
21,501 NVD and GHSA vulnerabilities disclosed within the past five years, along with 8,073 GitHub projects
that have disclosed vulnerabilities.
• A survey with 770 professional practitioners from 2,000 distinct GitHub repositories that had previously dis-
closed CVEs to shed light on practitioners’ preferences, including their views on various aspects of vulnerability
management.
• A set of empirically grounded guidelines practitioners can adopt when implementing vulnerability disclosure
management in their OSS projects.
• To facilitate research replicability and verifiability, we provide a replication package 1 that includes the datasets
and code used in our study , as well as a partial analysis of the questionnaire results .
2 BACKGROUND
Vulnerability Disclosure Model: Vulnerability disclosure models serve as guidelines for vulnerability discovers
and maintainers to report and handle vulnerabilities in OSS projects. There are three common vulnerability
disclosure models [ 42]: 1. Full Disclosure: The full details of the vulnerability are made public as soon as they
are identified. The full details may contain the exploit code. Thus, the full vulnerability details are usually
disclosed before a patch is available, exposing them to potential exploitation by attackers. 2. Private Disclosure:
The vulnerability is reported privately to the organization. The organization may choose to publish the details of
the vulnerabilities or not. This decision is made by the organization, not the vulnerability discoverers, meaning
that many vulnerabilities may never be made public. 3. Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) [ 29]: The initial
report is made privately. However, once a patch has been made available, full details of the vulnerability should
be published. Sometimes, publishing the vulnerability details could be delayed to allow more time for the patches
to be installed. It is widely adopted within the security community, including organizations such as Apache [ 5],
Microsoft [39], and Project Zero of Google [27].
