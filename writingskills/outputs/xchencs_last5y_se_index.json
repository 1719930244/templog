        "abstract": "Pseudo-code written by natural language is helpful for novice developers' program comprehension. However, writing such pseudo-code is time-consuming and laborious. Motivated by the research advancements of sequence-to-sequence learning and code semantic learning, we propose a novel deep pseudo-code generation method DeepPseudo via code feature extraction and Transformer. In particular, DeepPseudo utilizes a Transformer encoder to perform encoding for source code and then use a code feature extractor to learn the knowledge of local features. Finally, it uses a pseudo-code generator to perform decoding, which can generate the corresponding pseudo-code. We choose two corpora (i.e., Django and SPoC) from real-world large-scale projects as our empirical subjects. We first compare DeepPseudo with seven state-of-the-art baselines from pseudo-code generation and neural machine translation domains in terms of four performance measures. Results show the competitiveness of DeepPseudo. Moreover, we also analyze the rationality of the component settings in DeepPseudo.",

        "abstract": "Compilation errors happen during the debugging process of novice students. Compiler error messages help novices to localize and remove errors, but these messages are difficult to understand for students. Some computing education researchers analyzed the compiler error messages generated by novice's attempts to compile their programs. However, some important questions remain open. For example, the existing compilation error category cannot cover all programs due to the simple static analysis and program repair patterns. And existing prediction models for classifying compilation errors are unsatisfactory because of the inappropriate neural networks. In this paper, we first propose a new category of compilation error based on the program tokens, which is the smallest unit of the program. Then we develop a neural network model CLACER (ClAssification of Compilation ERrors) based on TextCNN. CLACER performs better on extracting semantic features and statistical features from compiler error messages. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed category and corresponding method CLACER, we choose 16,926 student programs as our experimental subjects. Final experimental results indicate that our proposed classification category covers 16.5% more programs than the state-of-the-art category TEGCER. Moreover, CLACER improves the compiler's localization effectiveness and with a 4.25% improvement on the TEGCER category. Further analysis shows that CLACER has a promising prediction performance for different error classes, and TextCNN is more suitable for constructing the compilation error classification model.",

        "abstract": "Developers often write low-quality code comments due to the lack of programming experience, which can reduce the efficiency of developers' program comprehension. Therefore, developers hope that code comment generation tools can be developed to illustrate the functionality and purpose of the code. Recently, researchers mainly model this problem as the neural machine translation problem and tend to use deep learning-based methods. In this study, we propose a novel method ComFormer based on Transformer and fusion method-based hybrid code presentation. Moreover, to alleviate OOV (out-of-vocabulary) problem and speed up model training, we further utilize the Byte-BPE algorithm to split identifiers and Sim_SBT method to perform AST Traversal. We compare ComFormer with seven state-of-the-art baselines from code comment generation and neural machine translation domains. Comparison results show the competitiveness of ComFormer in terms of three performance measures. Moreover, we perform a human study to verify that ComFormer can generate high-quality comments.",

        "abstract": "Bug severity is important for triagers. Recently, the text in the summary field (i.e., bug summary) of bug reports is usually used to extract features, and then bug report severity prediction models are constructed. In some bug reports, the bug summary may not contain enough useful information. While the text field in the description (i.e., bug description) of bug reports contains detailed information of the bug (e.g., steps to reproduce the bug, stack traces, and expected behavior). However, the bug description may contain irrelevant information. Motivated by the above findings, we propose a novel method EKD-BSP (Bug Report Severity Prediction by Extracting Keywords from Description), which uses the bug summary and the keywords extracted from the bug description to perform severity prediction. Our empirical study selects two large-scale open-source projects (i.e., Eclipse and Mozilla) as the empirical subjects. The empirical results show that EKD-BSP can improve the performance of F-measure by up to 5.19% after compared with the baselines.",

        "abstract": "Online judgment (OJ) systems can automatically evaluate program results by executing corresponding test cases. Among them, automatic fault localization techniques can assist students in localizing the root cause of program faults. However, artificially constructing many valid test cases is a very time-consuming and challenging task. Therefore, we propose an approach for automatically generating test data to solve this problem. Specifically, we utilize the real faulty novice programs from the OJ system as training data, and then we leverage the search algorithm to evolve the test data according to the fitness function. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on 1,136 faulty novice programs collected from the OJ system. The experimental results show that the test data generated by our approach can achieve the same fault detection ability as the artificially designed test data while has better fault localization accuracy for most fault localization techniques.",

        "abstract": "Fault localization is one of the most important processes in debugging. Among various automated fault localization techniques, Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) is one of the commonly studied that could achieve better performance in single-fault localization scenarios. However, the MBFL technique adopted First-Order-Mutants (FOMs) does not perform well in multiple-fault localization. In this paper, we propose an approach HMBFL (Higher-Order Mutation-Based Fault Localization) that first applies Higher-Order-Mutants (HOMs) in fault localization. To utilize HOMs on fault localization, we present three methods for calculating statements' suspiciousness (i.e., Averaging, Maxing, and Frequency). Furthermore, to generate more effective HOMs for fault localization, we propose two strategies that based on the traditional techniques (i.e., SBFL-guided and MBFL-guided). Our empirical results on 112 real-world multiple-fault programs from Codeflaws show that HMBFL outperforms SBFL techniques and traditional MBFL techniques at the metric of EXAM and HMBFL place more faults at the top 1, 3, 5 ranks.",

        "abstract": "There are increasing uses of deep learning (DL) compilers to generate optimized code, boosting the runtime performance of DL models on specific hardware. Like their traditional counterparts, DL compilers can generate incorrect code, resulting in unexpected model behaviors that may cause catastrophic consequences in mission-critical systems. On the other hand, the DL models processed by DL compilers differ fundamentally from imperative programs in that the program logic in DL models is implicit. As such, various characteristics of the bugs arising from traditional compilers need to be revisited in the context of DL compilers. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of DL compiler bugs by analyzing 603 bugs arising in three popular DL compilers (i.e., TVM from Apache, Glow from Facebook, and nGraph from Intel). We analyzed these bugs according to their root causes, symptoms, and the stages where they occur during compilation. We obtain 12 findings, and provide a series of valuable guidelines for future work on DL compiler bug detection and debugging. For example, a large portion (nearly 20%) of DL compiler bugs are related to types, especially tensor types. The analysis of these bugs helps design new mutation operators (e.g., adding type cast for a tensor to promote implicit type conversion in subsequent tensor computations) to facilitate type-related bug detection. Further, we developed TVMfuzz as a proof-of-concept application of our findings to test the TVM DL compiler. It generates new tests based on TVM's original test suite. They expose 8 TVM bugs that are missed by the original test suite. The result demonstrates the usefulness of our findings. © 2021 ACM.",

        "abstract": "As a popular Q&A site for programming, Stack Overflow is a treasure for developers. However, the amount of questions and answers on Stack Overflow make it difficult for developers to efficiently locate the information they are looking for. There are two gaps leading to poor search results: the gap between the user's intention and the textual query, and the semantic gap between the query and the post content. Therefore, developers have to constantly reformulate their queries by correcting misspelled words, adding limitations to certain programming languages or platforms, etc. As query reformulation is tedious for developers, especially for novices, we propose an automated software-specific query reformulation approach based on deep learning. With query logs provided by Stack Overflow, we construct a large-scale query reformulation corpus, including the original queries and corresponding reformulated ones. Our approach trains a Transformer model that can automatically generate candidate reformulated queries when given the user's original query. The evaluation results show that our approach outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves a 5.6% to 33.5% boost in terms of ExactMatch and a 4.8% to 14.4% boost in terms of GLEU.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Security vulnerability prediction (SVP) can construct models to identify potentially vulnerable program modules via machine learning. Two kinds of features from different points of view are used to measure the extracted modules in previous studies. One kind considers traditional software metrics as features, and the other kind uses text mining to extract term vectors as features. Therefore, gathered SVP data sets often have numerous features and result in the curse of dimensionality. In this article, we mainly investigate the impact of filter‐based ranking feature selection (FRFS) methods on SVP, since other types of feature selection methods have too much computational cost. In empirical studies, we first consider three real‐world large‐scale web applications. Then we consider seven methods from three FRFS categories for FRFS and use a random forest classifier to construct SVP models. Final results show that given the similar code inspection cost, using FRFS can improve the performance of SVP when compared with state‐of‐the‐art baselines. Moreover, we use McNemar's test to perform diversity analysis on identified vulnerable modules by using different FRFS methods, and we are surprised to find that almost all the FRFS methods can identify similar vulnerable modules via diversity analysis.",

        "abstract": "Identifying and fixing bug reports with tactical vul-nerabilities in a timely and accurate manner is essential to ensure the security of the software architecture. Manually identifying the bug reports with tactical vulnerabilities is labor-intensive and challenging. This paper presents Itactivul, an approach to automatically identify bug reports with tactical vulnerabilities and recommend their tactical categories to guide the fix. Unlike the existing security bug report prediction approach, we are the first attempt to use deep learning to mine discriminative tactical text features only from the vulnerability descriptions of the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and apply them to identify bug reports with tactical vulnerabilities. We evaluate Itactivul on three bug reports datasets gathered from three large-scale open-source projects, including Chromium, PHP, and Thunderbird. The experimental results show that Itactivul outperforms baselines by an average of 8.88 %, 13.58 %, and 6.61 % in the F1-score of three datasets, respectively. To improve the explainability of the features mined by Itactivul, we manually analyze the high-weight phrases extracted by using attention backtracking. The results show that Itactivul can mine key and potential tactical vulnerabilities text features.",

        "abstract": "Code summarization aims to automatically generate functionality descriptions of code snippets. Faithful metrics are needed to measure to which degree the machine generated summaries capture the semantics of the code snippets. Most commonly used metrics in code summarization, such as BLEU -4, METEOR, and ROUGE-L, originate from machine translation and text summarization, and have constantly been found to be inconsistent with human assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation metric, Consensus-based Code Summarization Evaluation (CCSE), which assigns different semantic weights to the n-grams of the summary. We also provide an algorithm to match the n-gram pairs from the reference and candidate based on the similarities. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed metric, we collect summary pairs from two public Java datasets and calculate the correlation coefficients between CCSE and the human evaluations. The experiment results show that, compared with BLEU-4, METEOR, and ROUGE-L, CCSE is more consistent with the scores assessed by human developers.",

        "abstract": "Concurrency programs often induce buggy results due to the unexpected interaction among threads. The detection of these concurrency bugs costs a lot because they usually appear under a specific execution trace. How to virtually explore different thread schedules to detect concurrency bugs efficiently is an important research topic. Many techniques have been proposed, including lightweight techniques like adaptive randomized scheduling (ARS) and heavyweight techniques like maximal causality reduction (MCR). Compared to heavyweight techniques, ARS is efficient in exploring different schedulings and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, it will lead to explore large numbers of redundant thread schedulings, which will reduce the efficiency. Moreover, it suffers from the \"cold start\" issue, when little information is available to guide the distance calculation at the beginning of the exploration. In this work, we propose a Heuristic-Enhanced Adaptive Randomized Scheduling (HARS) algorithm, which improves ARS to detect concurrency bugs guided with novel distance metrics and heuristics obtained from existing research findings. Compared with the adaptive randomized scheduling method, it can more effectively distinguish the traces that may contain concurrency bugs and avoid redundant schedules, thus exploring diverse thread schedules effectively. We conduct an evaluation on 45 concurrency Java programs. The evaluation results show that our algorithm performs more stably in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in detecting concurrency bugs. Notably, HARS detects hard-to-expose bugs more effectively, where the buggy traces are rare or the bug triggering conditions are tricky.",

        "abstract": "Identifying security bug reports (SBRs) accurately from a bug repository can reduce a software product's security risk. However, the class imbalance problem exists for SBR prediction since the number of SBRs is often limited, and this issue has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies. In our study, we choose six real-world projects of different sizes with over 120 000 bug reports in total as our empirical subjects. We first analyze the impact of the class imbalance issue on SBR prediction and confirm its negative impact on prediction performance. Then we perform a comparative study of six state-of-the-art class rebalancing methods combined with five popular classification algorithms for SBR prediction. By comparing with the baseline method Farsec, using the class rebalancing methods can improve the performance in 78% of cases in the worst case. Moreover, the combination of the Rose and random forest classification algorithm can construct the model with the best performance, which increases the performance by 267% in the best case and 75% on average in terms of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F1-score</i> . Finally, we summarize eight main findings based on our empirical studies' results, which can provide guidelines for choosing appropriate class rebalancing methods and classifiers for SBR prediction in practice.",

        "abstract": "Informal discussions on social platforms (e.g., Stack Overflow, CodeProject) have accumulated a large body of programming knowledge in the form of natural language text. Natural language process (NLP) techniques can be utilized to harvest this knowledge base for software engineering tasks. However, consistent vocabulary for a concept is essential to make an effective use of these NLP techniques. Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms (such as abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings) in informal discussions. Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either designed for general English or mainly resort to domain-specific lexical rules. A thesaurus, which contains software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms, is desirable to perform normalization for software engineering text. However, constructing this thesaurus in a manual way is a challenge task. In this paper, we propose an automatic unsupervised approach to build such a thesaurus. In particular, we first identify software-specific terms by utilizing a software-specific corpus (e.g., Stack Overflow) and a general corpus (e.g., Wikipedia). Then we infer morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations. Finally, we perform graph analysis on morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of our constructed thesaurus against community-cumulated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus. We demonstrate the usefulness of our constructed thesaurus by developing three applications and also verify the generality of our approach in constructing thesauruses from data sources in other domains.",

In this work, we conduct the first empirical study on numerical bugs in DL programs by analyzing the programs implemented on the top of two popular DL libraries (i.e., TensorFlow and PyTorch).

Because these technical debts can have a negative impact on software projects, we need to investigate the issue of technical debt in blockchain software systems. We wanted to investigate what types of self-introduced technical debt exist in open-source blockchain software systems, and how these technical debts are distributed. We have selected six most popular blockchain software projects from GitHub. Then the code comments from these software projects were extracted and manually labelled. Finally, the code comments were statistically analysed. We propose a new type of technical debt, resource debt, which is explicitly identified by the framework developers and requires special attention in subsequent production systems. Six types of technical debt are prevalent and there is not any algorithm debt. In addition, we find that the code comments containing technical debt are not entirely determined by task tags. SATD is prevalent in blockchain projects. There is more significant variability between different application software projects for different technical debts. The results of the study imply that for detecting SATD, deep semantic discovery models should be used, such as pre-trained models.",

        "abstract": "Developers use shell commands for many tasks, such as file system management, network control, and process management. Bash is one of the most commonly used shells and plays an important role in Linux system development and maintenance. Due to the language flexibility of Bash code, developers who are not familiar with Bash often have difficulty understanding the purpose and functionality of Bash code. In this study, we study Bash code comment generation problem and proposed an automatic method BASHEXPLAINER based on two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we train a Bash encoder by fine-tuning CodeBERT on our constructed Bash code corpus. In the second stage, we first retrieve the most similar code from the code repository for the target code based on semantic and lexical similarity. Then we use the trained Bash encoder to generate two vector representations. Finally, we fuse these two vector representations via the fusion layer and generate the code comment through the decoder. To show the competitiveness of our proposed method, we construct a high-quality corpus by combining the corpus shared in the previous NL2Bash study and the corpus shared in the NLC2CMD competition. This corpus contains 10,592 Bash codes and corresponding comments. Then we selected ten baselines from previous studies on automatic code comment generation, which cover information retrieval methods, deep learning methods, and hybrid methods. The experimental results show that in terms of the performance measures BLEU-3/4, METEOR, and ROUGR-L, BASHEXPLAINER can outperform all baselines by at least 8.75%, 9.29%, 4.77% and 3.86%. Then we design ablation experiments to show the component setting rationality of BASHEXPLAINER. Later, we conduct a human study to further show the competitiveness of BASHEXPLAINER. Finally, we develop a browser plug-in based on BASHEXPLAINER to facilitate the understanding of the Bash code for developers.",

        "abstract": "Fault localization is one of the most expensive activities in software debugging. Mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) is a commonly studied technique that applied mutation analysis to find the location of faults in the programs. Previous studies showed that MBFL adopted First-Order-Mutants (FOMs) that could achieve promising results in single-fault localization, but it did not perform well in multiple-fault localization. Recently, Higher-Order-Mutants (HOMs) were proposed for modeling complex faults but whether HOMs can help in fault localization is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the performance of MBFL with FOMs and HOMs on single- and multiple-fault localization. Moreover, to study the characteristics of HOMs, we divide HOMs into three groups (i.e. Accurate HOMs, Partially accurate HOMs, and Inaccurate HOMs) by considering different mutation locations. Based on the empirical results on 186 versions of six real-world programs, we find that (1) In single-fault localization, FOMs can achieve better performance than HOMs. (2) However, in multiple-fault localization, HOMs (2-HOMs) localize more faults than FOMs. (3) Furthermore, different types of HOMs have different fault localization effectiveness, where Accurate HOMs outperform the other two HOMs categories. Therefore, the researchers should propose methods to find HOMs more useful for fault localization.",

        "abstract": "Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) is one of the most widely studied techniques. MBFL adopts mutation analysis to generate mutants for revealing potential faults in the program. Previous studies proposed approaches to optimize MBFL in terms of efficiency and accuracy. However, these approaches ignored the difference of mutants on correct entities (such as statements) and faulty entities, which we refer this kind of difference as mutant bias. In this study, we identify and analyze the impact of mutant bias on MBFL. We find that the mutant bias may introduce effects to statement suspiciousness and negatively influence the fault localization accuracy of MBFL. To mitigate the mutant bias, we propose Delta4Ms, a model that captures the mutant bias from the mutants of the same statements. Then the real suspiciousness is obtained by removing the bias from the practical suspiciousness. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct experimental studies on 320 real-world programs from Codeflaws. The experimental results show that Delta4Ms improves the fault localization accuracy of MBFL. Besides, Delta4Ms outperforms the state-of-the-art SBFL and three MBFL techniques significantly. Moreover, Delta4Ms ranks 94 and 161 of the target faults within the top-5 suspicious statements in single-fault and multiple-fault programs, respectively.",

However, this process depends on the developers' expertise in assigning the correct bug severity. In our previous study, we propose a novel bug report severity prediction method EKD-BSP, which utilizes the bug summary and the keywords extracted from the bug description. However, a class imbalance exists in our gathered bug report severity prediction datasets. To solve this issue, we design a novel method CIL-BSP by further considering the class imbalanced methods. Moreover, we apply hyperparameter optimization to CIL-BSP and consider different optimization strategies. To verify the effectiveness of CIL-BSP, we select two real-world open-source projects Eclipse and Mozilla as our experimental subjects. Based on our empirical results, we find that performing hyper-parameter optimization can significantly improve the severity prediction performance of CIL-BSP.

        "abstract": "A shellcode is a small piece of code and it is executed to exploit a software vulnerability, which allows the target computer to execute arbitrary commands from the attacker through a code injection attack. Similar to the purpose of automated vulnerability generation techniques, the automated generation of shellcode can generate attack instructions, which can be used to detect vulnerabilities and implement defensive measures. While the automated summarization of shellcode can help users unfamiliar with shellcode and network information security understand the intent of shellcode attacks. In this study, we propose a novel approach DualSC to solve the automatic shellcode generation and summarization tasks. Specifically, we formalize automatic shellcode generation and summarization as dual tasks, use a shallow Transformer for model construction, and design a normalization method Adjust_QKNorm to adapt these low-resource tasks (i.e., insufficient training data). Finally, to alleviate the out-of-vocabulary problem, we propose a rule-based repair component to improve the performance of automatic shellcode generation. In our empirical study, we select a high-quality corpus Shellcode_IA32 as our empirical subject. This corpus was gathered from two real-world projects based on the line-by-line granularity. We first compare DualSC with six state-of-the-art baselines from the code generation and code summarization domains in terms of four performance measures. The comparison results show the competitiveness of DualSC. Then, we verify the effectiveness of the component setting in DualSC. Finally, we conduct a human study to further verify the effectiveness of DualSC.",

        "abstract": "On Stack Overflow, developers can not only browse question posts to solve their programming problems but also gain expertise from the question posts to help improve their programming skills. Therefore, improving the quality of question posts in Stack Overflow has attracted the wide attention of researchers. A concise and precise title can play an important role in helping developers understand the key information of the question post, which can improve the post quality. How-ever, the quality of the generated title is not high due to the lack of professional knowledge related to their questions or the poor presentation ability of developers. A previous study aimed to automatically generate the title by analyzing the code snippets in the question post. However, this study ignored the useful information in the corresponding problem description. Therefore, we propose an approach SOTitle for automatic post title generation by leveraging the code snippets and the problem description in the question post (i.e., the multi-modal input). SOTitle follows the Transformer structure, which can effectively capture long-term dependencies through a multi-head attention mechanism. To verify the effectiveness of SOTitle, we construct a large-scale high-quality corpus from Stack Overflow, which includes 1,168,257 high-quality question posts for four popular programming languages. Experimental results show that SOTitle can significantly outperform six state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. To encourage follow-up studies, we make our corpus and approach publicly available.",

        "abstract": "To improve the efficiency of the fault localization process, different automatic fault localization approaches have been proposed. Among these approaches, the spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) approach has been widely used and studied due to its lightweight and high effectiveness. However, while the existence of coincidental correct (CC) test cases can influence the usefulness of SBFL in single-fault programs, their influence on multiple fault programs has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in this article, we conduct a theoretical analysis and an empirical study to investigate the effect of CC test cases on multiple fault localization. The theoretical analysis is based on a suspiciousness calculation formula of SBFL, which divides CC test cases into three categories (specific, irrelevant, and unspecific) according to their association with a specific faulty statement. Following this analysis, we conduct an empirical study on two well-known open-source repositories (SIR and Defects4J), and the experimental results verify the correctness of our theoretical analysis. Specifically, reducing the number of specific CC test cases for a faulty statement can improve or maintain fault localization accuracy, while eliminating irrelevant CC test cases can have a negative effect. Finally, we design a CC test case identification solution based on the isolation-based multiple fault localization approach and demonstrate its effectiveness via a simulation experiment.",

        "abstract": "Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP), aiming to apply defect prediction models built on source projects to a target project, has been an active research topic. A variety of supervised CPDP methods and some simple unsupervised CPDP methods have been proposed. In a recent study, Zhou <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</i> found that simple unsupervised CPDP methods (i.e., ManualDown and ManualUp) have a prediction performance comparable or even superior to complex supervised CPDP methods. Therefore, they suggested that the ManualDown should be treated as the baseline when considering non-effort-aware performance measures (NPMs) and the ManualUp should be treated as the baseline when considering effort-aware performance measures (EPMs) in future CPDP studies. However, in that work, these unsupervised methods are only compared with existing supervised CPDP methods using a small subset of NPMs, and the prediction results of baselines are directly collected from the primary literatures. Besides, the comparison has not considered other recently proposed EPMs, which consider context switches and developer fatigue due to initial false alarms. These limitations may not give a holistic comparison between the supervised methods and unsupervised methods. In this paper, we aim to revisit Zhou <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</i> 's study. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make a comparison between the existing supervised CPDP methods and the unsupervised methods proposed by Zhou <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</i> in the same experimental setting when considering both NPMs and EPMs. We also propose an improved supervised CPDP method EASC and make a further comparison with the unsupervised methods. According to the results on 82 projects in terms of 11 performance measures, we find that when considering NPMs, EASC can achieve prediction performance comparable or even superior to unsupervised method ManualDown in most cases. Besides, when considering EPMs, EASC can statistically significantly outperform the unsupervised method ManualUp with a large improvement in terms of Cliff's delta in most cases. Therefore, the supervised CPDP methods are more promising than the unsupervised method in practical application scenarios, since the limitation of testing resource and the impact on developers cannot be ignored in these scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In vulnerability detection approaches based on deep learning, fine-tuning with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) is a prevalent technique. Unfortunately, a natural gap exists between model pre-training tasks and vulnerability detection tasks due to different input formats, and the performance of fine-tuning relies on downstream dataset scales. Recently, prompt tuning has been used to alleviate these issues. However, it has not received enough attention in vulnerability detection. To assess the effectiveness of prompt tuning, we consider three classical vulnerability detection tasks: within-domain vulnerability detection, cross-domain vulnerability detection, and vulnerability type detection. Our empirical study considers three popular PLMs: CodeBERT, CodeT5, and CodeGPT. Then we use Devign, BigVul, and Reveal datasets as our experimental subjects. Our empirical results indicate that (1) compared to fine-tuning, prompt tuning can increase the accuracy of three tasks by an average of 42 %, 38%, and 41 %, respectively; (2) different prompt templates can have up to an 8 % impact on accuracy; (3) in data scarcity scenarios, the superiority of prompt tuning over fine-tuning is more obvious. Our research demonstrates that using prompt tuning can help to achieve better performance in vulnerability detection tasks and is a promising research direction in the future.",

        "abstract": "Just-In- Time defect prediction models can identify defect-inducing commits at check-in time and many approaches are proposed with remarkable performance. However, these approaches still have a few limitations which affect their effectiveness and practical usage: (1) partially using semantic information or structure information of code, (2) coarsely providing results to a commit (buggy or clean), and (3) independently investigating the defect prediction model and defect repair model. In this study, to handle the aforementioned limitations, we propose a unified defect prediction and repair framework named COMPDEFECT,which can identify whether a changed function inside a commit is defect-prone, categorize the type of defect, and repair such a defect automatically if it falls into several scenarios, e.g., defects with single statement fixes, or those that match a small set of defect templates. Technically, the first two tasks in COMPDEFECT are treated as a multiclass classification task, while the last task is treated as a sequence generation task. To verify the effectiveness of COMPDEFECT, we first build a large-scale function-level dataset (i.e., 21,047) named Function-SStuBs4J and then compare COMPDEFECT with tens of state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by considering five performance measures. The experimental results indicate that COMPDEFECT outperforms all SOTAs with a substantial improvement in three tasks separately. Moreover, the pipeline experimental results also indicate the feasibility of COMPDEFECT to unify three tasks in a model.",

It will eliminate unimportant variables and improve the accuracy as well as the performance of classification. Random Forest has emerged as a quite useful algorithm that can handle the feature selection issue even with a higher number of variables. In this paper, we use three popular datasets with a higher number of variables (Bank Marketing, Car Evaluation Database, Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones) to conduct the experiment. There are four main reasons why feature selection is essential. First, to simplify the model by reducing the number of parameters, next to decrease the training time, to reduce overfilling by enhancing generalization, and to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Besides, we evaluate and compare each accuracy and performance of the classification model, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The highest accuracy of the model is the best classifier. Practically, this paper adopts Random Forest to select the important feature in classification. Our experiments clearly show the comparative study of the RF algorithm from different perspectives. Furthermore, we compare the result of the dataset with and without essential features selection by RF methods varImp(), Boruta, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to get the best percentage accuracy and kappa. Experimental results demonstrate that Random Forest achieves a better performance in all experiment groups.",

However, MBFL incurs a high execution cost as it needs to execute the test suite on a large number of mutants. While previous studies have proposed mutant reduction methods for FOMs (First-Order Mutants) to help alleviate the cost of MBFL, the reduction of HOMs (Higher-Order Mutants) has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we propose SGS (Statement Granularity Sampling), a method which conducts HOMs reduction for HMBFL (Higher-Order Mutation-Based Fault Localization). Considering the relationship between HOMs and statements, we sample HOMs at the statement level to ensure each statement has corresponding HOMs. We empirically evaluate the fault localization effectiveness of HMBFL using SGS on 237 multiple-fault programs taken from the SIR and Codeflaws benchmarks. The experimental results show that (1) The best sampling ratio for HMBFL with SGS is 20%, which preserves the performance and reduces execution costs by 80% ; (2) The fault localization accuracy of HMBFL with SGS outperforms the state-of-the-art SBFL (Spectrum-Based Fault Localization) and MBFL techniques by 20%.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have been conducted on software vulnerability (SV) assessment at the code-based level, especially the function level. However, a key limitation of these studies is that they do not consider the structure information (e.g., control dependency and data dependency) of a vulnerable function, which is crucial for understanding SVs and assigning priority for fixing. In this study, we propose a flow-sensitive, multitask, and function-level vulnerability assessment method named FVA, which considers both global structure information and local semantic information. More specifically, FVA considers two types of flow information extracted from the control dependence graph and the data dependence graph. Meanwhile, FVA also considers the deep semantic information of the statement as well as its various types of contexts (i.e., surrounding context and program slicing context). We evaluate the effectiveness of FVA on the large-scale dataset (4,467 functions) by comparing it with four state-of-the-art baselines in terms of five performance measures. The experimental results indicate that FVA outperforms these baselines by a significant margin. More precisely, on average, FVA obtains 0.795 of F1-score and 0.727 of MCC, which improves baselines by 5%-14% and 8%-20%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Question posts with low-quality titles often discourage potential answerers in Stack Overflow. In previous studies, researchers mainly focused on directly generating question titles by analyzing the contents of the posts. However, the quality of the generated titles is still limited by the information available in the post contents. A more effective way is to provide accurate completion suggestions when developers compose titles. Inspired by this idea, we are the first to study the problem of automatic question title completion for Stack Overflow and then propose a novel approach QTC4SO. Specifically, we first preprocess the gathered post titles to form incomplete titles (i.e., tip information provided by developers) for simulating the scene of this task. Then we construct the multi-modal input by concatenating the incomplete title with the post's contents (i.e., the problem description and the code snippet). Later, we adopt multi-task learning to the question title completion task for multiple programming languages. Finally, we adopt a pre-trained model T5 to learn the title completion patterns automatically. To evaluate the effectiveness of QTC4SO, we gathered 164,748 high-quality posts from Stack Overflow by covering eight popular programming languages. Our empirical results show that compared with the approaches of directly generating question titles, our proposed approach QTC4SO is more practical in automatic and human evaluation. Therefore, our study provides a new direction for automatic question title generation and we hope more researchers can pay attention to this problem in the future.",

        "abstract": "Mutation-based fault localization has shown promising accuracy in localizing faults due to its finer analysis granularity. However, the effectiveness is limited when dealing with diverse real-world systems and actual faults, which results from its inflexible suspiciousness calculation and oversimplification of information. In this work, we propose a novel Mutation-Based Fault Localization technique, GMBFL, which utilizes Graph representation to achieve multi-information cooperation to improve fault localization. GMBFL comprises two key components: a fine-grained graph-based representation to fully utilize the information of the program, and an effective suspiciousness measure using the graph neural network to learn useful features from the graph. We evaluate GMBFL on 243 real faulty programs from Defects4J. The experimental results show that GMBFL can surpass both the state-of-the-art learning-based fault localization technique and 70 commonly used SBFL and MBFL techniques. In particular, GMBFL localizes 125 faults within TOP-1 whereas the best baseline technique can at most localize 109 faults within TOP-1.",

        "abstract": "Abstract As agile software development and extreme programing have become increasingly popular, continuous integration (CI) has become a widely used collaborative work method. However, it is common to make changes frequently to a project during CI. If existing testing methods are applied to CI directly, it will be difficult to make testing resources focus on changes generated by CI, which results in insufficient testing for changes. To solve this problem, we propose a fuzz testing method for CI. First, differential analysis is performed to determine the change points generated during CI, change points are added to the taint source set, and static analysis is conducted to calculate the distances between each basic block and the taint sources. Then, the project under test is instrumented according to the distances. During fuzz testing, testing resources are allocated based on seed coverage to test the change points effectively. Using the proposed methods, we implement CIDFuzz as a prototype tool, and experiments are conducted on four open‐source projects that use CI. Experimental results show that, compared with AFL and AFLGo, CIDFuzz can reduce the time costs of covering change points up to 39.59% and 41.64%, respectively. Also, CIDFuzz can reduce the time costs of reproducing vulnerabilities up to 34.78% and 25.55%.",

        "abstract": "Based on developer needs and usage scenarios, API (Application Programming Interface) recommendation is the process of assisting developers in finding the required API among numerous candidate APIs. Previous studies mainly modeled API recommendation as the recommendation task, which can recommend multiple candidate APIs for the given query, and developers may not yet be able to find what they need. Motivated by the neural machine translation research domain, we can model this problem as the generation task, which aims to directly generate the required API for the developer query. After our preliminary investigation, we find the performance of this intuitive approach is not promising. The reason is that there exists an error when generating the prefixes of the API. However, developers may know certain API prefix information during actual development in most cases. Therefore, we model this problem as the automatic completion task and propose a novel approach APICom based on prompt learning, which can generate API related to the query according to the prompts (i.e., API prefix information). Moreover, the effectiveness of APICom highly depends on the quality of the training dataset. In this study, we further design a novel gradient-based adversarial training method ATCom for data augmentation, which can improve the normalized stability when generating adversarial examples. To evaluate the effectiveness of APICom, we consider a corpus of 33k developer queries and corresponding APIs. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, our experimental results show that APICom can outperform all baselines by at least 40.02%, 13.20%, and 16.31% in terms of the performance measures EM@1, MRR, and MAP. Finally, our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our component setting (such as our designed adversarial training method, our used pre-trained model, and prompt learning) in APICom.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Compilation errors are unavoidable during the debugging process of novice students. Compiler error messages can help novices to localize and remove errors, but these messages are difficult to understand for students. Previous studies have investigated the compilation error categorization by analyzing compiler error messages, but the categorization cannot cover all kinds of errors, which limits the evaluation of compilation error studies. Therefore, a comprehensive categorization for compilation errors is needed for evaluating the performance of models or tools related to compilation errors. In this study, we first propose a new compilation error categorization, which is based on the smallest unit of the program, tokens. The experiments on 29,573 programs from three datasets show that our proposed compilation error categorization can cover more types of errors and the distribution of the error categorization are significantly different between the datasets. Then, based on our proposed categorization, we develop a neural network model CLACER (CLAssification of Compilation ERrors) for predicting the compilation errors. The results indicate that CLACER can improve the compiler's error localization accuracy and predicts the compilation error effectively. Moreover, based on the proposed categorization, we conduct empirical studies to evaluate the performance of three repairing tools (i.e., DeepFix, RLAssist, and MACER). The comparison results illustrate that DeepFix and RLAssist can fix more errors in the category of delimiter than errors in other categories. Furthermore, MACER performs better than DeepFix and RLAssist because it has a sufficient repairing pattern set for the errors. We also provide some suggestions for improving the repairing tools in the future.",

        "abstract": "Automatically localizing faulty statements is a desired feature for effective learning programming. Most of the existing automated fault localization techniques are developed and evaluated on commercial or well-known open-source projects, which performed poorly on novice programs. In this paper, we propose a novel fault localization technique VsusFL (Variable-suspiciousness-based Fault Localization) for novice programs. VsusFL is inspired by simulating the manual program debugging process and takes advantage of variable value sequences. VsusFL can trace variable value changes, determine whether the intermediate state of the variables is correct, and report the potential faulty statements for novice programs. This paper presents the implementation of VsusFL and conducts empirical studies on 422 real faulty novice programs. Experimental results show that VsusFL performs much better than Grace, ANGELINA, VSBFL, Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL), and Variable-based Fault Localization (VFL) in terms of TOP-1, TOP-3, and TOP-5 metrics. Specifically, VsusFL can localize 90%, 35% and 9% more faulty statements than the best-performing baseline Grace. Moreover, We analyze the correlation between VsusFL and other techniques and find a weak correlation since they perform well on different programs, indicating the potential to further enhance fault localization performance through strategic integration of VsusFL with other methods.",

        "abstract": "With the applications of intelligent systems in areas (such as self-driving cars, robotics, and smart cities), the impact of these intelligent systems' defects cannot be ignored. For example, in a recent report, the self-driving car collided with another self-driving car because it incorrectly identified a roadblock. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct adequate testing of intelligent systems to avoid dangerous behaviors as much as possible. However, due to the particularity of its own structure, the low efficiency, and the high cost of manual collection the large-scale test cases, it is important and challenging to design tools to test the adequacy of intelligent systems.To overcome the above problems, we propose an intelligent system test adequacy evaluation tool ISTA. ISTA implements the automatic generation and optimization of test cases based on coverage analysis, which can improve the test adequacy of the intelligent system while expanding the dataset. To evaluate the usefulness of our developed tool, we analyze the application of ISTA on the five-layer fully-connected dnn model and german credit dataset (text data type) for binary classification as well as on the Rambo model and hmb dataset (image data type) for self-driving car. The evaluation results show that the test dataset is expanded and the models are more fully tested after ISTA's test case generation and optimization for both text and image data types, with a corresponding increase in the average 80% coverage criteria used.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Identifying the location of faults in real‐world programs is one of the costly processes during software debugging. To reduce the debugging effort, various fault localization techniques have been proposed in recent years. Spectrum‐based fault localization (SBFL) is one kind of widely investigated fault localization technique. Most SBFL techniques first calculate the suspiciousness of program elements (such as statements, methods) to be faulty using the coverage information and execution results of tests. Then a rank list of program elements is generated according to their suspiciousness. However, some SBFL techniques only consider the binary coverage information (i.e., whether the program element is covered) but ignore some of the tests' running behaviors, such as the execution frequency when faults occur in the iteration entities or loop bodies, which are more likely to be faulty followed the propagation‐infection‐execution model. The execution frequency based techniques only replace the feature items of the existing formula limiting their effectiveness in fault localization. In this article, we propose a fault localization technique, class reduction and method call frequency (CRMF), which utilizes mutation analysis and information retrieval techniques. In particular, CRMF first uses mutation analysis to identify and reduce the classes, in which the program elements with a low probability of being faulty. Then we propose a new suspiciousness formula that applies information retrieval and considers method call frequency. To evaluate the effectiveness of CRMF, we conduct empirical studies on 264 real‐world programs from the Defects4J benchmark. Final results show that CRMF outperforms the statement frequency based technique FLSF and SBFL techniques (i.e., Ochiai, OP2, Tarantula, and Dstar) in both single‐fault programs and multiple‐fault programs. Specifically, CRMF can rank 29, 74, and 112 faults at the top 1, 3, 5 ranks and achieve a higher mean reciprocal rank for single‐fault programs and multiple‐fault programs. Finally, we discuss the essence of CRMF and analyze its effectiveness on multi‐fault programs in detail.",

        "abstract": "Test case prioritization (TCP) has been widely studied in regression testing, which aims to optimize the execution order of test cases so as to detect more faults earlier. TCP has been divided into white-box test case prioritization (WTCP) and black-box test case prioritization (BTCP) . WTCP can achieve better prioritization effectiveness by utilizing source code information, but is not applicable in many practical scenarios (where source code is unavailable, e.g., outsourced testing). BTCP has the benefit of not relying on source code information, but tends to be less effective than WTCP. That is, both WTCP and BTCP suffer from limitations in the practical use. To improve the practicability of TCP, we aim to explore better BTCP, significantly bridging the effectiveness gap between BTCP and WTCP. In this work, instead of statically analyzing test cases themselves in existing BTCP techniques, we conduct the first study to explore whether this goal can be achieved via log analysis. Specifically, we propose to mine test logs produced during test execution to more sufficiently reflect test behaviors, and design a new BTCP framework (called LogTCP), including log pre-processing, log representation, and test case prioritization components. Based on the LogTCP framework, we instantiate seven log-based BTCP techniques by combining different log representation strategies with different prioritization strategies. We conduct an empirical study to explore the effectiveness of LogTCP. Based on 10 diverse open-source Java projects from GitHub, we compared LogTCP with three representative BTCP techniques and four representative WTCP techniques. Our results show that all of our LogTCP techniques largely perform better than all the BTCP techniques in average fault detection, to the extent that they become competitive to the WTCP techniques. That demonstrates the great potential of logs in practical TCP.",

        "abstract": "Pre-trained code generation models (PCGMs) have been widely applied in neural code generation, which can generate executable code from functional descriptions in natural languages, possibly together with signatures. Despite substantial performance improvement of PCGMs, the role of method names in neural code generation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this article, we study and demonstrate the potential of benefiting from method names to enhance the performance of PCGMs from a model robustness perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, named neu RA l co D e gener A tor R obustifier (RADAR). RADAR consists of two components: RADAR -Attack and RADAR -Defense. The former attacks a PCGM by generating adversarial method names as part of the input, which are semantic and visual similar to the original input but may trick the PCGM to generate completely unrelated code snippets. As a countermeasure to such attacks, RADAR -Defense synthesizes a new method name from the functional description and supplies it to the PCGM. Evaluation results show that RADAR -Attack can reduce the CodeBLEU of generated code by 19.72% to 38.74% in three state-of-the-art PCGMs (i.e., CodeGPT, PLBART, and CodeT5) in the fine-tuning code generation task and reduce the Pass@1 of generated code by 32.28% to 44.42% in three state-of-the-art PCGMs (i.e., Replit, CodeGen, and CodeT5+) in the zero-shot code generation task. Moreover, RADAR -Defense is able to reinstate the performance of PCGMs with synthesized method names. These results highlight the importance of good method names in neural code generation and implicate the benefits of studying model robustness in software engineering.",

        "abstract": "Automated code comment generation technologies can help developers understand code intent, which can significantly reduce the cost of software maintenance and revision. The latest studies in this field mainly depend on deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural network. However, these methods may not generate high-quality and readable code comments due to the long-term dependence problem, which means that the code blocks used to summarize information are far from each other. Owing to the long-term dependence problem, these methods forget the previous input data’s feature information during the training process. In this article, to solve the long-term dependence problem and extract both the text and structure information from the program code, we propose a novel improved-Transformer-based comment generation method, named SeTransformer. Specifically, the SeTransformer utilizes the code tokens and an abstract syntax tree (AST) of programs to extract information as the inputs, and then, it leverages the self-attention mechanism to analyze the text and structural features of code simultaneously. Experimental results based on public corpus gathered from large-scale open-source projects show that our method can significantly outperform five state-of-the-art baselines (such as Hybrid-DeepCom and AST-attendgru). Furthermore, we also conduct a questionnaire survey for developers, and the results show that the SeTransformer can generate higher quality comments than those of other baselines.",

        "abstract": "Testing multi-threaded programs is challenging due to the enormous space of thread interleavings. Recently, a code coverage criterion for multi-threaded programs called MAP-coverage has been proposed and shown to be effective for testing concurrent programs. Existing approaches for achieving high MAP-coverage are based on random testing with simple heuristics, which is ineffective in systematically triggering rare thread interleavings. In this study, we propose a novel approach called pattern constraint reduction (PCR), which employs optimized constraint solving to generate thread interleavings for high MAP-coverage. The idea is to iteratively encode and solve path conditions to generate thread interleavings which are guaranteed to improve MAP-coverage. Furthermore, we effectively apply interpolation techniques to reduce the efforts of constraint solving by avoiding solving infeasible constraints. The experiment results on 20 benchmark programs show that our approach complements existing random testing based approaches when there are rare failure-inducing interleaving in the whole search space. Specifically, PCR finds concurrency bugs faster in 18 out of 20 programs, with an average speedup of 4.2x and a maximum speedup of 11.4x.",

        "abstract": "In Stack Overflow, developers may not clarify and summarize the critical problems in the question titles due to a lack of domain knowledge or poor writing skills. Previous studies mainly focused on automatically generating the question titles by analyzing the posts' problem descriptions and code snippets. In this study, we aim to improve title quality from the perspective of question title reformulation and propose a novel approach <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">QETRA</monospace> motivated by the findings of our formative study. Specifically, by mining modification logs from Stack Overflow, we first extract title reformulation pairs containing the original title and the reformulated title. Then we resort to multi-task learning by formalizing title reformulation for each programming language as separate but related tasks. Later we adopt a pre-trained model T5 to automatically learn the title reformulation patterns. Automated evaluation and human study both show the competitiveness of <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">QETRA</monospace> after compared with six state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, our ablation study results also confirm that our studied question title reformulation task is more practical than the direct question title generation task for generating high-quality titles. Finally, we develop a browser plugin based on <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">QETRA</monospace> to facilitate the developers to perform title reformulation. Our study provides a new perspective for studying the quality of post titles and can further generate high-quality titles.",

        "abstract": "Summary Online judgment (OJ) systems are capable of evaluating program results by automatically executing test cases, significantly improving the efficiency of traditional guidance approaches. Moreover, existing studies attempt to assist novices through automated fault localization techniques to provide feedback to novices, which can help them quickly find the location of faulty statements. Among them, spectrum‐based fault localization (SBFL) techniques have been widely used for their lightweight and efficiency, which only requires coverage information and test results of test cases to conduct fault localization. However, manually constructing high‐quality test cases for a large number of OJ questions is tough work to complete. To solve this problem, we propose the novice program‐oriented M ulti‐Objective Optimization‐Based F ault Localization‐Oriented T est C ase G eneration (MFTCG) for automatically generating test inputs. Specifically, we use multi‐objective optimization algorithms to evolve the test case in terms of both fault localization and faulty code detection capability. We conduct experiments with 8911 programs from the well‐known public OJ platform AtCoder. The results show that our proposed approach MFTCG can achieve the best fault localization performance compared with existing automated test case generation approaches in most cases and can achieve the similar faulty code detection capability compared to manually designed test cases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract As software grows in size and complexity, software vulnerabilities are increasing, leading to a range of serious insecurity issues. Open‐source software vulnerability reports and documentation can provide researchers with great convenience for analysis and detection. However, the quality of different data sources varies, the data are duplicated and lack of correlation, which often requires a lot of manual management and analysis. In order to solve the problems of scattered and heterogeneous data and lack of correlation in traditional vulnerability repositories, this paper proposes a software vulnerability feature knowledge extraction method that combines the N‐gram model and mask similarity. The method generates mask text data based on the extraction of N‐gram candidate keywords and extracts vulnerability feature knowledge by calculating the similarity of mask text. This method analyzes the samples efficiently and stably in the environment of large sample size and complex samples and can obtain high‐value semi‐structured data. Then, the final node, relationship, and attribute information are obtained by secondary knowledge cleaning and extraction of the extracted semi‐structured data results. And based on the extraction results, the corresponding software vulnerability domain knowledge graph is constructed to deeply explore the semantic information features and entity relationships of vulnerabilities, which can help to efficiently study software security problems and solve vulnerability problems. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method is verified by comparing it with several traditional keyword extraction algorithms on Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability data.",

        "abstract": "Smart contracts are computer programs that run on a blockchain. As the functions implemented by smart contracts become increasingly complex, the number of cross-contract interactions within them also rises. Consequently, the combinatorial explosion of transaction sequences poses a significant challenge for smart contract security vulnerability detection. Existing static analysis-based methods for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities suffer from high false-positive rates and cannot generate test cases, while fuzz testing-based methods exhibit low code coverage and may not accurately detect security vulnerabilities. The goal of this paper is to address the above limitations and efficiently detect cross-contract vulnerabilities. To achieve this goal, we present CrossFuzz, a fuzz testing-based method for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities. First, CrossFuzz generates parameters of constructors by tracing data propagation paths. Then, it collects inter-contract data flow information. Finally, CrossFuzz optimizes mutation strategies for transaction sequences based on inter-contract data flow information to improve the performance of fuzz testing. We implemented CrossFuzz, which is an extension of ConFuzzius, and conducted experiments on a real-world dataset containing 396 smart contracts. The results show that CrossFuzz outperforms xFuzz, a fuzz testing-based tool optimized for cross-contract vulnerability detection, with a 10.58% increase in bytecode coverage. Furthermore, CrossFuzz detects 1.82 times more security vulnerabilities than ConFuzzius. Our method utilizes data flow information to optimize mutation strategies. It significantly improves the efficiency of fuzz testing for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Fault localization is a complex, costly and time‐consuming task in software debugging. Numerous automated techniques have been developed to expedite this process. Mutation‐based fault localization (MBFL) is one of the most widely studied techniques which uses mutation analysis to generate mutants for revealing potential faults in the program. However, our theoretical analysis exposes an inherent conflict between the fundamental assumption and the essential meaning of existing MBFL suspiciousness. This conflict is caused by mutant bias. Intuitively, the suspiciousness can be corrected by eliminating the mutant bias for more accurately measuring the faulty probability of the corresponding mutant statement. In this paper, we introduce Delta4Ms, a fault localization approach designed to eliminate mutant bias. Delta4Ms integrates the principles of signal theory, modelling the actual suspiciousness and mutant bias as the desired and false signal components, respectively. Based on theoretical derivation, the average suspiciousness of mutants serves as an estimate of mutant bias. Delta4Ms effectively mitigates mutant bias, extracting the desired signal and yielding corrected suspiciousness for fault localization. To precisely estimate mutant bias, higher order mutants (HOMs) are incorporated. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of Delta4Ms on 320 real‐fault programs from Codeflaws. The results indicate that our model significantly outperforms existing SBFL and MBFL techniques, showing a considerable improvement in fault localization effectiveness. We further assessed the robustness of Delta4Ms by examining different HOM ratios and HOM generation strategies. Moreover, Delta4Ms achieves a substantial reduction in mutation execution cost and minimal accuracy loss through the implementation of test case reduction. Finally, we perform preliminary experiments on 15 real‐fault programs from the Defects4J benchmark to assess the generalization of the model's fault localization effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used in various fields. However, it is essential to perform sufficient testing to detect internal defects before deploying CNNs, especially in security-sensitive scenarios. Generating error-inducing inputs to trigger erroneous behavior is the primary way to detect CNN model defects. However, in practice, when the model under test is a black-box CNN model without accessible internal information, in some scenarios it is still necessary to generate high-quality test inputs within a limited testing budget. In such a new scenario, a potential approach is to generate transferable test inputs by analyzing the internal knowledge of other white-box CNN models similar to the model under test, and then use transferable test inputs to test the black-box CNN model. The main challenge in generating transferable test inputs is how to improve their error-inducing capability for different CNN models without changing the test oracle. We found that different CNN models make predictions based on features of similar important regions in images. Adding targeted perturbations to important regions will generate transferable test inputs with high realism. Therefore, we propose the Interpretable Analysis-based Transferable Test (IATT) Generation method for CNNs, which employs interpretation methods of CNN models to explain and localize important regions in test inputs, using backpropagation optimizer and perturbation mask process to add targeted perturbations to these important regions, thereby generating transferable test inputs. This process is repeated to iteratively optimize the transferability and realism of the test inputs. To verify the effectiveness of IATT, we perform experimental studies on nine deep learning models, including ResNet-50 and Vit-B/16, and commercial computer vision system Google Cloud Vision , and compared our method with four state-of-the-art baseline methods. Experimental results show that transferable test inputs generated by IATT can effectively cause black-box target models to output incorrect results. Compared to existing testing and adversarial attack methods, the average Error-inducing Success Rate (ESR) in different testing scenarios is 18.1%–52.7% greater than the baseline methods. Additionally, the test inputs generated by IATT achieve high ESR while maintaining high realism.",

However, most of these variants mainly focus on code representation without distinguishing between different code token types, while some focus on a specific type, such as code identifiers. Indeed, various code token types exist, and there is no evidence that only identifiers can improve PTMs. Thus, to improve PTMs through different types, we conducted an extensive study to evaluate how different type-specific masking tasks can affect PTMs. First, we extract five code token types, convert them into type-specific masking tasks, and generate their combinations. Second, we pre-train CodeBERT and PLBART using combinations and fine-tuned them on four SE downstream tasks. Experimental results show that type-specific masking tasks can enhance CodeBERT and PLBART on all downstream tasks. Furthermore, we discuss topics related to low-resource datasets, conflicting PTMs that original pre-training tasks conflict with our methods, the cost and performance of our methods, factors that impact the performance of our methods, and applying our methods on state-of-the-art PTMs. These discussions comprehensively analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different type-specific masking tasks.",

        "abstract": "Recently, with the widespread use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in high-stakes decision-making systems (such as fraud detection and prison sentencing), concerns have arisen about the fairness of DNNs in terms of the potential negative impact they may have on individuals and society. Therefore, fairness testing has become an important research topic in DNN testing. At the same time, the neural network coverage criteria (such as criteria based on neuronal activation) is considered as an adequacy test for DNN white-box testing. It is implicitly assumed that improving the coverage can enhance the quality of test suites. Nevertheless, the correlation between DNN fairness (a test property) and coverage criteria (a test method) has not been adequately explored. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic empirical study on seven coverage criteria, six fairness metrics, three fairness testing techniques, and five bias mitigation methods on five DNN models and nine fairness datasets to assess the correlation between coverage criteria and DNN fairness. Our study achieved the following findings: 1) with the increase in the size of the test suite, some of the coverage and fairness metrics changed significantly, as the size of the test suite increased; 2) the statistical correlation between coverage criteria and DNN fairness is limited; and 3) after bias mitigation for improving the fairness of DNN, the change pattern in coverage criteria is different; 4) Models debiased by different bias mitigation methods have a lower correlation between coverage and fairness compared to the original models. Our findings cast doubt on the validity of coverage criteria concerning DNN fairness (i.e., increasing the coverage may even have a negative impact on the fairness of DNNs). Therefore, we warn DNN testers against blindly pursuing higher coverage of coverage criteria at the cost of test properties of DNNs (such as fairness).",

        "abstract": "The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by 34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Several code comment generation approaches based on sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models have been proposed. Such approaches often extract structure information from abstract syntax trees (ASTs) using a certain serialization method. However, some structural information is inevitably lost while serializing ASTs. Furthermore, existing serialization methods only consider the “type” attribute of the nodes, neglecting the “value” attribute of the nodes. To further improve the performance of code comment generation, we propose a code comment generation approach, called SCATCom, which integrates a more comprehensive set of information from source code and ASTs, encompassing semantic, sequential, syntactic, and hierarchical structure information for code comment generation. Meanwhile, an AST traversal method, called V-POT, is presented, which considers both the “type” and the “value” attributes of the nodes. Experiments were designed and conducted on two commonly used datasets to validate the performance of our approach and the impact of five different serialization ways of ASTs on two code comment generation methods. The BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores for our approach reach 52.6, 34.16, and 63.26 with an improvement of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] compared to the baselines. It is evident that V-POT, which retains both the “type” and the “value” attributes, is superior to other methods that use only the “type” attribute.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) frameworks are essential to DL-based software systems, and framework bugs may lead to substantial disasters, thus requiring effective testing. Researchers adopt DL models or single interfaces as test inputs and analyze their execution results to detect bugs. However, floating-point errors, inherent randomness, and the complexity of test inputs make it challenging to analyze execution results effectively, leading to existing methods suffering from a lack of suitable test oracles. Some researchers utilize metamorphic testing to tackle this challenge. They design Metamorphic Relations (MRs) based on input data and parameter settings of a single framework interface to generate equivalent test inputs, ensuring consistent execution results between original and generated test inputs. Despite their promising effectiveness, they still face certain limitations. (1) Existing MRs overlook structural complexity, limiting test input diversity. (2) Existing MRs focus on limited interfaces, which limits generalization and necessitates additional adaptations. (3) Their detected bugs are related to the result consistency of single interfaces and far from those exposed in multi-interface combinations and runtime metrics (e.g., resource usage). To address these limitations, we propose ModelMeta, a model-level metamorphic testing method for DL frameworks with four MRs focused on the structure characteristics of DL models. ModelMeta augments seed models with diverse interface combinations to generate test inputs with consistent outputs, guided by the QR-DQN strategy. It then detects bugs through fine-grained analysis of training loss/gradients, memory/GPU usage, and execution time. We evaluate the effectiveness of ModelMeta on three popular DL frameworks (i.e., MindSpore, PyTorch, and ONNX) with 17 DL models from ten real-world tasks ranging from image classification to object detection. Results demonstrate that ModelMeta outperforms state-of-the-art baselines from the perspective of test coverage and diversity of generated test inputs. Regarding bug detection, ModelMeta has identified 31 new bugs, of which 27 have been confirmed, and 11 have been fixed. Among them, seven bugs existing methods cannot detect, i.e., five wrong resource usage bugs and two low-efficiency bugs. These results demonstrate the practicality of our method.",

Code intelligence tasks have shown promising performance with the support of code pre-trained language models. Pre-processing code simplification methods have been introduced to prune code tokens from the model’s input while maintaining task effectiveness. These methods improve the efficiency of code intelligence tasks while reducing computational costs. Post-prediction code simplification methods provide explanations for code intelligence task outcomes, enhancing the reliability and interpretability of model predictions. However, comprehensive evaluations of these methods across diverse code pre-trained model architectures and code intelligence tasks are lacking. To assess the effectiveness of code simplification methods, we conduct an empirical study integrating these code simplification methods with various pre-trained code models across multiple code intelligence tasks. Our empirical findings suggest that developing task-specific code simplification methods would be beneficial. Then, we recommend leveraging post-prediction methods to summarize prior knowledge, which can pre-process code simplification strategies. Moreover, establishing more evaluation mechanisms for code simplification is crucial. Finally, we propose incorporating code simplification methods into the pre-training phase of code pre-trained models to enhance their program comprehension and code representation capabilities.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancements, significantly impacting various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and software engineering. These LLMs, exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, have revolutionized the way we approach language understanding and generation tasks. However, in contrast to traditional software development practices, LLM development introduces new challenges for AI developers in design, implementation, and deployment. These challenges span different areas (such as prompts, APIs, and plugins), requiring developers to navigate unique methodologies and considerations specific to LLM application development. Despite the profound influence of LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been thoroughly investigated in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study on understanding the challenges faced by LLM developers. Specifically, we crawl and analyze 29,057 relevant questions from a popular OpenAI developer forum. We first examine their popularity and difficulty. After manually analyzing 2,364 sampled questions, we construct a taxonomy of challenges faced by LLM developers. Based on this taxonomy, we summarize a set of findings and actionable implications for LLM-related stakeholders, including developers and providers (especially the OpenAI organization).",

        "abstract": "Code Language Models (CLMs), particularly those leveraging deep learning, have achieved significant success in code intelligence domain. However, the issue of security, particularly backdoor attacks, is often overlooked in this process. The previous research has focused on designing backdoor attacks for CLMs, but effective defenses have not been adequately addressed. In particular, existing defense methods from natural language processing, when directly applied to CLMs, are not effective enough and lack generality, working well in some models and scenarios but failing in others, thus fall short in consistently mitigating backdoor attacks. To bridge this gap, we first confirm the phenomenon of \"early learning\" as a general occurrence during the training of CLMs. This phenomenon refers to that a model initially focuses on the main features of training data but may become more sensitive to backdoor triggers over time, leading to overfitting and susceptibility to backdoor attacks. We then analyze that overfitting to backdoor triggers results from the use of the cross-entropy loss function, where the unboundedness of cross-entropy leads the model to increasingly concentrate on the features of the poisoned data. Based on this insight, we propose a general and effective loss function DeCE (Deceptive Cross-Entropy) by blending deceptive distributions and applying label smoothing to limit the gradient to bounded, which prevents the model from overfitting to backdoor triggers and then enhances the security of CLMs against backdoor attacks.",

        "abstract": "Pre-trained models (PTMs) have succeeded in various software engineering (SE) tasks following the “pre-train then fine-tune” paradigm. As fully fine-tuning all parameters of PTMs can be computationally expensive, a potential solution is parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which freezes PTMs while introducing extra parameters. Although PEFT methods have been applied to SE tasks, researchers often focus on specific scenarios and lack a comprehensive comparison of PTMs from different aspects such as field, size, and architecture. To fill this gap, we have conducted an empirical study on six PEFT methods, eight PTMs, and four SE tasks. The experimental results reveal several noteworthy findings. For example, model architecture has little impact on PTM performance when using PEFT methods. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive discussion of PEFT methods from three perspectives. First, we analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of PEFT methods. Second, we explore the impact of the scaling factor hyperparameter. Finally, we investigate the application of PEFT methods on the latest open source large language model, Llama 3.2. These findings provide valuable insights to guide future researchers in effectively applying PEFT methods to SE tasks.",

        "abstract": "The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering has intensified the need for improved model and resource efficiency. In particular, for neural code generation, LLMs are used to translate function/method signature and DocString to executable code. DocStrings, which capture user requirements for the code and are typically used as the prompt for LLMs, often contain redundant information. Recent advancements in prompt compression have shown promising results in Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their applicability to code generation remains uncertain. Our empirical study shows that the state-of-the-art prompt compression methods achieve only about 10% reduction, as further reductions would cause significant performance degradation. In our study, we propose a novel compression method, ShortenDoc, dedicated to DocString compression for code generation. Our experiments on six code generation datasets, five open source LLMs (1B to 10B parameters), and one closed-source LLM GPT-4o confirm that ShortenDoc achieves 25–40% compression while preserving the quality of generated code, outperforming other baseline methods at similar compression levels. The benefit of this method is to improve efficiency and reduce the token processing cost while maintaining the quality of the generated code, especially when calling third-party APIs.",

        "abstract": "Novice programmers often face challenges in fault localization due to their limited experience and understanding of programming syntax and logic. Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.",

        "abstract": "Cryptography has become an essential tool in information security, preserving data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, despite rigorous analysis, cryptographic algorithms may still be susceptible to attack when used on real-world devices. Side-channel attacks (SCAs) are physical attacks that target cryptographic equipment through quantifiable phenomena such as power consumption, operational times, and EM radiation. These attacks are considered to be a significant threat to cryptography since they compromise the integrity of the algorithm by obtaining the internal cryptographic key of a device by seeing its physical implementation. The literature on SCAs has focused on real-world devices, yet with the growing popularity of sophisticated devices like smartphones, fresh approaches to SCAs are necessary. One such approach is electromagnetic side-channel analysis (EM-SCA), which gathers information by listening to electromagnetic (EM) radiation. EM-SCA has been demonstrated to recover sensitive data like encryption keys and has the potential to identify malicious software, retrieve data, and identify program activity. This study aims to evaluate how well EM-SCA compromises encryption under various application scenarios, as well as examine the role of EM-SCA in digital forensics and law enforcement. Regarding this, addressing the susceptibility of encryption algorithms to EM-SCA approaches can provide digital forensic investigators with the tools they desire to overcome the challenges posed by strong encryption, allowing them to continue playing a crucial role in law enforcement and the justice system. Furthermore, this paper seeks to define the current state of EM-SCA in terms of attacking encryption, the encryption algorithms and encrypted devices that are most vulnerable and resistant to EM-SCA, and the most promising EM-SCA on encryption approaches. This study will provide a comprehensive analysis of EM-SCA in the context of law enforcement and digital forensics and point towards potential directions for further research.",
